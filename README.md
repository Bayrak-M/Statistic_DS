# Statistic Notes
You will find topic wise statistic questions and their solutions in Python. I used several libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Scipy.stats to solve the questions to show python in action. The topics are as follows

* Binomial Distribution
* Poisson Distribution
* Normal Distribution
* Confidence Intreval
* One Sample T Test
* Tests on the Difference in Means of Two Normal Distributions, Variances Unknown and Equal
* Paired Sample T Test
* Probality
* Probability Distribution
* Central Limit Theorem
* Hypothesis Testing
